After a long flight, I finally arrived in Tokyo! The moment I stepped out of Narita Airport, I could feel the energy of this incredible city.

## Morning - Shibuya Crossing

My first stop was the famous Shibuya Crossing. Watching hundreds of people cross from all directions at once was mesmerizing. I grabbed a coffee at a nearby café and just people-watched for an hour.

## Afternoon - Meiji Shrine

In contrast to the bustling streets, the Meiji Shrine offered a peaceful escape. Walking through the massive torii gate and into the forest-like grounds felt like entering another world, right in the heart of Tokyo.

## Evening - Shinjuku

As night fell, I explored the neon-lit streets of Shinjuku. The area is overwhelming in the best way possible - countless restaurants, shops, and the famous Robot Restaurant. I ended up having the best ramen of my life at a tiny hole-in-the-wall spot.

Can't wait to explore more tomorrow!
