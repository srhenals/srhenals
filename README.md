## 🌟 About Me

I'm a **Flutter + iOS developer** (and sometimes backender) who loves clean UIs, solid architecture, and privacy-first tools.  
In games, I'm the support. In life, I'm the same.  
Big fan of Tolkien, open source, and exploring new ideas.

> “It's the job that never gets started that takes longest to finish.” – Tolkien
